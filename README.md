The platform allows users to explore available loans, check details, submit loan applications, track application progress, and manage their profiles. Managers can add new loans, update existing ones, approve or reject applications, verify payments, and manage loan visibility on the home page. Admins have full control over users, including role assignment and suspension functionality to restrict account access when required.

Key features include role-based authentication, loan filtering, home page loan showcasing, form validation, real-time updates using React Query, secure API handling through protected routes, and an intuitive, responsive interface built with Tailwind and DaisyUI. Suspended users are blocked from logging in, whether via email/password or social login, ensuring proper access control. The system also includes EMI details, required documents, image uploads, timestamps, and complete application tracking.

This project uses several npm packages, including React Router, React Hook Form, Axios, React Query, SweetAlert2, Firebase Authentication, JWT, Express, MongoDB, Cors, Dotenv, and others essential for building a full-stack production application.
